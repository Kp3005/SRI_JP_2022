# PricePared.com - Price Comparison Web application

This is a price comparison web app that allows the customers to compare prices of general grocery items
sold by multiple retail stores like D-mart accross your city. Those looking to save money on
purchases are more likely to use a price comparison tool to help them with their research.
This not only saves money but saves time as well.

1. Customers

3. Updates Manager (for each store updates prices)
4. Counter Manager (for each store works like a cashier)
